Description (from the web site): AI for Teachers is a website dedicated to supporting the integration of Artificial Intelligence knowledge throughout K-12 learning. We believe educators need high quality curated resources and a supportive community in order to navigate the challenges of integrating new content into their existing classes. AI education is needed for all types of educators and grade levels, so we offer free professional development, webinars, conference presentations, and peer-to-peer learning opportunities. We feature awesome schools, classrooms, and informal learning spaces so you can see exactly how other people like you are adding artificial intelligence to their programs. And, we keep the focus on ethical creation of technology with hands-on learning experiences in our Tools section.
