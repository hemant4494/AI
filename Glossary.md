* **Agent:** any artificial intelligence entity that interacts with the world via a _sense-deliberate-act_ cycle. Agents may be physical devices such as robots, or exist purely as software, such as automated stock-trading programs.

* **Artificial intelligence:** a body of techniques that allow computers to do things that, when humans do them, are considered evidence of intelligence.

* **Machine learning:** A subfield of Artificial Intelligence focusing on techniques to improve a computer's performance on a task through exposure to "training data".

* **Perception:** The extraction of meaning from sensory signals.

* **Turing test:** a thought experiment proposed by the mathematician Alan Turing to justify the claim that a machine could possess "intelligence". A human interrogator engages in dialog via teletype machine with both another human being and a computer posing as a human being. If the interrogator cannot reliably distinguish the machine from the human, the machine can be said to be intelligent.
