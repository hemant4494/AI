Summary (from the document): Thinking with KIBO is a curriculum introducing early elementary age children to core concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI), using KIBO as an “object to think with” (borrowing Seymour Papert’s phrase from his 1980 book Mindstorms). KIBO is a hands-on, screen free robot kit designed to introduce coding, engineering, and computer science in early childhood education. Although KIBO is not an advanced AI system, working with KIBO provides children with a concrete way to approach the concepts.

The curriculum consists of five lessons: (1) AI and Automation, (2) Sensing and Organizing, (3) A KIBO Rover, (4) What is KIBO's Personality?, and (5) KIBO Can Help Us!. Each 1 hour lesson uses the KIBO robot's modest capabilities to prompt students to think about broader AI topics and more advanced AI technologies.
