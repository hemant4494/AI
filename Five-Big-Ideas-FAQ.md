### Why are there only five big ideas?

CSTAâ€™s experience developing the 2011 and 2017 national standards for K-12 computing education showed that five big ideas was the right number, balancing the need for depth with the need for simplicity. We followed their lead.

### Why are the big ideas presented in this particular order, starting with perception?

The numbers are just for convenient reference. They do not indicate the priority or significance of their respective topics. Nor do they indicate the order in which big ideas must be introduced in a curriculum that aligns with the guidelines. In many cases we expect curriculum modules on complex topics (e.g., self-driving cars, or AI and healthcare) to reference all of the big ideas.
