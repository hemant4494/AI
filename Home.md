Welcome to the ai4k12 wiki! This interim site is being used to organize the AI for K-12 initiative jointly sponsored by [AAAI](https://AAAI.org) and [CSTA](https://csteachers.org). This page will help us get started on the dialog that will eventually result in (1) national guidelines for AI education for K-12, (2) an online, curated resource Directory to facilitate AI instruction, and (3) a community of resource and tool developers focused on the AI for K-12 audience. 
* To read about the progress of the initiative, see these [slides](https://github.com/touretzkyds/ai4k12/raw/master/documents/ISTE_2019_Presentation_website_final.pdf).
