Welcome to the ai4k12 wiki! This interim site is being used to organize the AI for K-12 initiative jointly sponsored by [AAAI](https://AAAI.org) and [CSTA](https://csteachers.org). This page will help us get started on the dialog that will eventually result in (1) national guidelines for AI education for K-12, and (2) an online, curated resource directory to facilitate AI instruction.

### Upcoming Events

* "AI for K-12" symposium, October 20, 2018 in Washington, DC, part of the AAAI Fall Symposium series. Twitter hashtag [#AI4K12](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AI4K12&src=typd).

### Resources
The AI for K-12 guidelines will be modeled after the 2017 CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards. You can:

* [Read about the CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards](https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards). Click on the "Standards" pulldown menu to view a searchable version of the standards.

* Download a [PDF version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TlX1G3mywqbXpydGdIVk00Y1U/view) of the standards.

* [View the K-12 Computer Science Framework](https://k12cs.org/), which informed the development of the standards
