Welcome to the ai4k12 wiki! This interim site is being used to organize the AI for K-12 initiative jointly sponsored by [AAAI](https://AAAI.org) and [CSTA](https://csteachers.org). This page will help us get started on the dialog that will eventually result in (1) national guidelines for AI education for K-12, and (2) an online, curated resource directory to facilitate AI instruction.

### Upcoming Events

* "Blue sky talk" at [AAAI-19](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-19/) (January 27-February 1, 2019, in Honolulu, HI). Here is the paper: [Envisioning AI for K-12: What should every child know about AI?](https://github.com/touretzkyds/ai4k12/raw/master/documents/AAAI_Blue_Sky_2019.pdf)
