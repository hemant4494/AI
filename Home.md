Welcome to the ai4k12 wiki! This is interim site is being used to organize the "AI for K-12" initiative jointly sponsored by [AAAI](https://AAAI.org) and [CSTA](https://csteachers.org). This page will help us get started on the dialog that will eventually result in (1) national guidelines for AI education for K-12, and (2) an online, curated resource directory to facilitate AI instruction.

### Upcoming Events
* CSTA 2018 conference, July 7-10 in Omaha, Nebraska. Visit the [conference web site](https://www.csteachers.org/general/custom.asp?page=2018Conference) for more information. We will be holding a **AI for K-12 breakfast** for CSTA attendees on July 10. Everyone with an interest in AI education is welcome.

* "AI for K-12" symposium, October 20, 2018 in Washington, DC, part of the AAAI Fall Symposium series.

### Resources
* The AI for K-12 guidelines will be modeled after the CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards.
