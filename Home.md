Welcome to the ai4k12 wiki! This is interim site is being used to organize the AI for K-12 initiative jointly sponsored by [AAAI](https://AAAI.org) and [CSTA](https://csteachers.org). This page will help us get started on the dialog that will eventually result in (1) national guidelines for AI education for K-12, and (2) an online, curated resource directory to facilitate AI instruction.

### Upcoming Events
* CSTA 2018 conference, July 7-10 in Omaha, Nebraska. Visit the [conference web site](https://www.csteachers.org/general/custom.asp?page=2018Conference) for more information. We will be holding a **AI for K-12 breakfast** for CSTA attendees on July 10. Everyone with an interest in AI education is welcome.

* "AI for K-12" symposium, October 20, 2018 in Washington, DC, part of the AAAI Fall Symposium series. Registration information will be announced soon.

### Resources
The AI for K-12 guidelines will be modeled after the 2017 CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards. You can:

* [Read about the CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards](https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards)

* [View the standards](https://sites.google.com/site/cstastandards/standards) (or download a [PDF version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0TlX1G3mywqXzNWMVdKX0lTSkU))

* [View the K-12 Computer Science Framework](https://k12cs.org/), which informed the development of the standards

### Administration
* The AI for K-12 initiative is chaired by Professor David Touretzky of Carnegie Mellon University.

* To join the AI for K-12 mailing list, send mail to [ai4k12@aaai.org](mailto:ai4k12@aaai.org).

* The AI for K-12 Working Group is being formed now. We are currently seeking active K-12 teachers in all grade levels. A list of members will be released once the working group is complete.
