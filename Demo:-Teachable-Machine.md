This is one of the most popular online machine learning demos. In just a minute you can train a neural network to classify images from your webcam into three categories. All training is done right in the browser. The demo is built on a technique called "transfer learning", where a deep neural network is first pre-trained on a complex visual classification task. Then, the many hidden layers are frozen and retained, and the output layer is replaced by a new one which is trained on the simple classification you're trying to learn. Learning is very only the last layer or two is undergoing training.

From the web site: This experiment lets anyone explore how machine learning works, in a fun, hands on way. You can teach a machine to using your camera, live in the browser – no coding required. You train a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHvf7Tagt18" target="_blank" class="link">neural network</a> locally on your device, without sending any images to a server. That’s how it responds so quickly to you.
