Description (from the web site): This experiment lets anyone explore how machine learning works, in a fun, hands on way. You can teach a machine to using your camera, live in the browser – no coding required. You train a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHvf7Tagt18" target="_blank" class="link">neural network</a> locally on your device, without sending any images to a server. That’s how it responds so quickly to you.
