Students should know that:

# Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science.

# Artificial intelligence is concerned with getting computers to do things that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding language or driving a car.

# Artificial intelligence has several subdisciplines, including:
** Computer vision
** Speech recognition
** Machine learning
** Natural language understanding
** Planning
** Game playing
** Automated reasoning / theorem proving
** Robotics

# Artificial intelligence has had great success in narrow domains such as chess, but computers are not yet capable of the kind of general intelligence that humans exhibit.
** Computers do not yet "think" the way people do. Whether they ever will is an unsettled question.
** Today's robots typically include some forms of artificial intelligence, but they are not conscious or self-aware. Robots with human-like intelligence exist today only in science fiction stories.
