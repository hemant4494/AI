From the ISTE web site: The Hands-On AI Projects for the Classroom guides from ISTE and GM provide elementary, secondary, elective and computer science teachers with innovative curricular resources about AI across various grade levels and subject areas. Each guide includes background information and four student-driven projects that directly relate to subject area standards, while providing foundational learning on what AI is, how it works and how it impacts society.

With these hands-on projects, students work directly with innovative AI technologies, participate in “unplugged” activities and create various products – from designing chatbots to presentations to video games – to demonstrate their learning. These hands-on guides are available in English, Spanish and Arabic.
