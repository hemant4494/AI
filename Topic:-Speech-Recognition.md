# _These are working notes for a topic area_

## Grade Progression: What should students know?

* **Grades K-2:** Some types of devices can recognize human speech. This includes most cellphones, and home entertainment systems like Amazon's Echo or Google Home.

* **Grades 3-5:** Speech recognition systems use grammatical knowledge to disambiguate homophones such as bear/bare or there/their/they're. Example: "_There_ is no hot water" vs. "_Their_ hot water is off" vs. "_They're_ waiting for the hot water to come back on".

* **Grades 6-8:**

* **Grades 9-12:**

## Miscellaneous concepts to incorporate

Audio -> Formants -> Phones -> Syllables -> Words -> Phrases

How neural nets improved speech recognition: use of massive training data.

Grammar: recognition does best with conversational English

"How to recognize speech" == "How to wreck a nice beach"

Languages other than English

Accents; child voices

Applications: Alexa, Siri, Cortana. What do they do? How are they useful?
