Description (from the web site): "This unit is a hands-on introduction to developing a machine learning model with tabular data. You will explore how computers learn from data to make decisions, then develop machine learning projects around real-world data. The unit culminates in designing a machine learning app to solve a personally relevant problem."

The module uses Code.org's new AI/ML tool to train classifier models using tabular datasets. The student can then import that classifier for use in a simulated app constructed using a tool modeled after MIT App Inventor.
