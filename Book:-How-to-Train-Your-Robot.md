Summary (from the book's web site): ""This engaging 24-page book for young readers tells the story of 4th graders who build a robot to clean up their Razzle-Dazzle Robot Club workshop.  When it doesn't work as expected, they visit their local university where they discover new research in Artificial Intelligence and robot learning. The book introduces readers to cutting-edge robotics and AI in a highly accessible way and models authentic engineering practices such as iterative design, testing, and learning through failure. With a diverse cast of characters and colorful, humorous illustrations, How to Train Your Robot will inspire girls and members of other under-represented groups to explore engineering,robotics, and coding for themselves."
