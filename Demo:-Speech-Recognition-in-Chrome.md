Description: this demo uses the Google Speech API to record audio from the computer's microphone and return strings indicating the best hypotheses for what the speaker said. These hypotheses are displayed in rank order (highest score first). There will usually be more than one, and sometimes none of them are correct. The demo illustrates the current state of the art in speech recognition, and its limitations.

Some things to demonstrate:
* Longer utterances usually work better than one or two word utterances.
* Grammatical utterances are recognized much more easily than random strings of words.
* Careful enunciation improves the recognition rate.
