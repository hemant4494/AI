This page offers a selection of links to videos that demonstrate how self-driving cars work. Most of the links are to longer lectures but are pre-cued to the time where the cool demos are shown.

* [How Does It Work? Autonomous Car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEy91PGGLR0). A short (3 minutes) animation by Thomas Schwenke that explains the basics of self-driving cars.

* [How Self-Driving Cars Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly92UcnoEMY&t=90s), David Silver, TEDxWilmingtonSalon. Start at 1:30 into this 9 minute video to get a nice technical (but totally accessible) overview of self-driving cars.

* [Chris Urmson: How a driverless car sees the road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiwVMrTLUWg&t=469s). A 15.5 minute video by Google's Chris Urmson, but skip ahead to 7:49 to get to the good stuff.
