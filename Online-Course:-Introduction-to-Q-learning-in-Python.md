Summary: free online course introduces concepts of probability and expected reward, then moves on to the Q-learning algorithm and applies it to maze solving and playing tic-tac-toe. The course is organized as a Jupyter notebook that runs in the browser. It offers clear explanations and a logical development of topics, and is not Python-heavy; it is accessible to any student familiar with basic coding constructs (variables, conditionals, loops, and functions).
