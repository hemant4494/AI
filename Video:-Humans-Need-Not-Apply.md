Description: a well-reasoned look at how AI and robotic automation will impact human employment in virtually every area, from low-skilled jobs to white collar, professional, and creative jobs. Great use of visuals, and a good explanation of why this situation is likely to turn out differently than the three previous industrial revolutions (steam, electricity, and computing).
